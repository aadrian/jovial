# JUnit Maven Sample

**NOTE:** This one doesn't work yet!

[Official JUnit Maven Docs](http://junit.org/junit5/docs/current/user-guide/#build-support)

This project is an attempt at a Maven sample, but I'm a total newb so don't expect too much...

Sample `clojure.test` tests are included in the `src/test/clojure` directory.

Run the tests with:

```
mvn test
```

You'll see the basic console output from JUnit with any failures or messages from `clojure.test`.
