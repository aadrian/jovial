JUnit Platform engines for Clojure test frameworks

![CI](https://github.com/ajoberstar/jovial/workflows/CI/badge.svg)

## Why do you care?

The [JUnit Platform](https://junit.org/junit5/) is a de-factor standard in the Java community. In polyglot projects, there is advantage in running everything through the same test runner.

## What is it?

A JUnit Platform test engine for Clojure testing frameworks.

Currently supporting:

- [clojure.test](https://clojure.github.io/clojure/clojure.test-api.html)

## Usage

**NOTE:** *All* jovial modules require Java 8 (or higher).

* [Release Notes](https://github.com/ajoberstar/jovial/releases)

## Questions, Bugs, and Features

Please use the repo's [issues](https://github.com/ajoberstar/jovial/issues)
for all questions, bug reports, and feature requests.

## Contributing

Contributions are very welcome and are accepted through pull requests.

Smaller changes can come directly as a PR, but larger or more complex
ones should be discussed in an issue first to flesh out the approach.

If you're interested in implementing a feature on the
[issues backlog](https://github.com/ajoberstar/jovial/issues), add a comment
to make sure it's not already in progress and for any needed discussion.

## Acknowledgements

Thanks to the [JUnit5 team](https://github.com/junit-team/junit5/graphs/contributors) for putting together a great new API!
