## Questions, Bugs, and Features

Please use the repo's [issues](https://github.com/ajoberstar/jupiter/issues)
for all questions, bug reports, and feature requests.

## Contributing

Contributions are very welcome and are accepted through pull requests.

Smaller changes can come directly as a PR, but larger or more complex
ones should be discussed in an issue first to flesh out the approach.

If you're interested in implementing a feature on the
[issues backlog](https://github.com/ajoberstar/jupiter/issues), add a comment
to make sure it's not already in progress and for any needed discussion.
